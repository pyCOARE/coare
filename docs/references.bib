Emphasis is put on those aspects that are important from a modeling point of view, e.g., surface roughness lengths for momentum and heat, stomatal resistance for evaporation, and related quantities. Special attention is paid to the problem of subgrid surface inhomogeneities up to horizontal scales of a few kilometers. A qualitative explanation is given for the apparent low values of the roughness length for heat. Simple flux parameterizations are compared with observations, and empirical closure functions are proposed to model the transfer coefficients between the surface and the first model layer.},

It is found that in the unstable marine surface layer, ζ = C Rib(1 + Rib/Ribc)−1, where the numerical coefficient C and the saturation Richardson number Ribc are analytical functions of the standard bulk exchange coefficients. For measurements at a height of 10–15 m, C is about 10 and Ribc is about −4.5. Their values are insensitive to variations of Rib and ζ over three decades. Thus, a simple dependence between ζ and Rib has a much wider range of applicability than previously believed. The authors show that this behavior is the result of the effects of “gustiness” driven by boundary layer–scale convective eddies. The derived relationship can be used as a first guess for ζ in bulk flux routines and reduces or eliminates the need for lengthy iterative solutions. Using this approximation yields errors in the latent heat flux of a few watts per square meter, compared to the full iterative solution.},

	abstract = {Python implementation of the COARE 3.5 algorithm developed at NOAA Physical Sciences Lab. The COARE model followed from the international TOGA-COARE field program which took place in the western Pacific warm pool over 4 months from November 1992 to February 1993 (Fairall et al. 1996a, 1996b and 1997).  The algorithm is intended to provide estimates of momentum, sensible heat, and latent heat fluxes using inputs of bull atmospheric variables (wind speed, SST, air temperature, air humidity).  The algorithm contains subroutines to deal with near-surface gradients of temperature in the ocean.  Version 2.5 was published in 1996 and a major update, version 3.0 was published in 2003.  This update was based on new observations at higher wind speeds (10 to 20 m/s).  Version 3.5 was released in 2013 following the publication of Edson et al. 2013, which made adjustments to the wind speed dependence of the Charnock parameter based on a large data base of direct covariance stress observations (principally from a buoy).  This led to an increase in stress for wind speeds greater than about 18 m/s.  The roughness Reynolds number formulation of the scalar roughness length was tuned slightly to give the same values of Ch and Ce as version 3.0.  The diurnal warm layer model was structured as a separate routine instead of embedded in a driver program.  COARE 3.5 was based on Edson’s buoy data (Edson et al. 2013) and was compared to a large data base (a total of 16,000 hours of observations) combining observations from NOAA, WHOI, and U. Miami (Fairall et al. 2011).},

The system includes tower-mounted micrometeorological sensors for direct covariance ﬂux measurements and a variety of remote sensors for proﬁling winds, temperature, moisture, and turbulence. A sonic anemometer/thermometer and a fast-response infrared hygrometer are used for turbulent ﬂuxes. Winds are obtained from a stabilized Doppler radar (wind proﬁler) and a Doppler sodar. Returned power and Doppler width from these systems are used to deduce proﬁles of small-scale turbulence. A lidar ceilometer and a microwave radiometer are used to obtain cloud properties. Radiative ﬂuxes are measured with standard pyranometers and pyrgeometers. A conventional rawinsonde system gives intermittent reference soundings. The system is used to study surface ﬂuxes, boundary layer dynamics, cloud–radiative interactions, and entrainment. It has also proven useful in satellite calibration/validations. Following a description of the systems and methods, various examples of data and results are given from recent deployments in the North Atlantic, off the United States west coast, and in the equatorial Paciﬁc Ocean.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the exchange of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean using data collected from four oceanic ﬁeld experiments. Direct covariance estimates of momentum ﬂuxes were collected in all four experiments and wind proﬁles were collected during three of them. The objective of the investigation is to improve parameterizations of the surface roughness and drag coefﬁcient used to estimate the surface stress from bulk formulas. Speciﬁcally, the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) 3.0 bulk ﬂux algorithm is reﬁned to create COARE 3.5. Oversea measurements of dimensionless shear are used to investigate the stability function under stable and convective conditions. The behavior of surface roughness is then investigated over a wider range of wind speeds (up to 25 m s21) and wave conditions than have been available from previous oversea ﬁeld studies. The wind speed dependence of the Charnock coefﬁcient a in the COARE algorithm is modiﬁed to a 5 mU10N 1cobr,rwechteiorne:mm5= 00..001071m7 21 s and b 5 20.005. When combined with a parameterization for smooth ﬂow, this formulation gives better agreement with the stress estimates from all of the ﬁeld programs at all winds speeds with signiﬁcant improvement for wind speeds over 13 m s21. Wave age– and wave slope–dependent parameterizations of the surface roughness are also investigated, but the COARE 3.5 wind speed–dependent formulation matches the observations well without any wave information. The available data provide a simple reason for why wind speed–, wave age–, and wave slope–dependent formulations give similar results—the inverse wave age varies nearly linearly with wind speed in long-fetch conditions for wind speeds up to 25 m s21.},

Flux-profile relations which are based on the postulation of intermittent renewal of the surface fluid aye matched to the logarithmic profiles and compared with both field and laboratory measurements. These relations enable numerical determination of air-sea exchanges of momentum, heat and water vapor (or bulk transfer coefficients) employing the bulk parameters of mean wind speed, temperature and humidity at a certain height in the atmospheric surface layer, and the water temperature. With increasing wind speed, the flow goes from smooth to rough and the bulk transfer coefficient for momentum also increases. The increase in roughness is associated with increasing wave height which in the present model results in sheltering at the wave troughs. Due to the decrease in turbulent transports, the transfer coefficients of heat and water vapor decrease slightly with wind speed after the wind speed exceeds a certain value. The bulk transfer coefficients are also found to decrease with increasing stability. If the “bucket temperature” which typically gives the water temperature a few centimeters below the surface is used, rather than the interfacial temperature, erroneous results may be obtained when the air-sea temperature difference is small. By including the effects of stability and interfacial conditions in bulk parameterization, the model provides a way to account for physical conditions which are known to affect air-sea exchanges.},

	abstract = {Under low-wind, unstable conditions over water, the Liu, Katsaros and Businger (LKB) estimate of the buoyancy flux into the atmosphere has the form ν1/3 ΔB4/3 g(ξ), where 22.7ξ is the ratio of the Monin-Obukhov length to the calm-water roughness length; ΔB is the buoyancy difference between air just above the ocean surface and the ambient air above, and ν is viscosity. An analytic expression for g(ξ) is obtained, for low winds; g(ξ) has a minimum at about ξ=40 (corresponding over tropical oceans to wind speeds of about 0.3–0.6 m s−1). For lower values of x the assumptions underlying the LKB algorithm are no longer valid. For a reasonable choice of dimensionless constants, g(ξ) varies only by 8\% over 40{\textless}ξ{\textless}200, being just above the minimum. Thus the LKB flux estimates are nearly independent of wind speed at their lower limit of applicability; it seems reasonable to identify this LKB minimum flux with laboratory observations of fluxes at zero wind. These show that the buoyancy flux is given by C* Pr−⅔ ν1/3 ΔB4/3, where measured values of C* are about 0.14±0.01 (Golitsin and Grachev, 1986). With Pr=0.71 for air, this implies that g(0) = 0.19 — well within the allowable range of values for the minimum of g(ξ). However, the minimum in g(ξ) varies as (γAT)1/3, where γ is the dimensionless constant in the Dyer-Hicks-Businger stability profile and AT the constant in the scalar roughness length for low winds; this can be used to fix AT. In field applications, buoyant motions in the planetary boundary layer ensure that r.m.s. wind speeds wG just above the surface are generally greater than the wind speed at the minimum of g(ξ), even for dry convection — though this would not be true if the planetary boundary layer were typically 100 m thick, instead of 1000 m. This “gustiness” is allowed for by replacing mean wind speed U by (U2+wG2)½ in the bulk formulae.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The past decade has seen significant technological advance in the observation of trace gas fluxes over the open ocean, most notably CO$_{\textrm{2}}$, but also an impressive list of other gases. Here we will emphasize flux observations from the air-side of the interface including both turbulent covariance (direct) and surface-layer similarity-based (indirect) bulk transfer velocity methods. Most applications of direct covariance observations have been from ships but recently work has intensified on buoy-based implementation. The principal use of direct methods is to quantify empirical coefficients in bulk estimates of the gas transfer velocity. Advances in direct measurements and some recent field programs that capture a considerable range of conditions with wind speeds exceeding 20 ms$^{\textrm{-1}}$ are discussed. We use coincident direct flux measurements of CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and dimethylsulfide (DMS) to infer the scaling of interfacial viscous and bubble-mediated (whitecap driven) gas transfer mechanisms. This analysis suggests modest chemical enhancement of CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ flux at low wind speed. We include some updates to the theoretical structure of bulk parameterizations (including chemical enhancement) as framed in the COAREG gas transfer algorithm.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In 1996, version 2.5 of the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) bulk algorithm was published, and it has become one of the most frequently used algorithms in the air–sea interaction community. This paper describes steps taken to improve the algorithm in several ways. The number of iterations to solve for stability has been shortened from 20 to 3, and adjustments have been made to the basic profile stability functions. The scalar transfer coefficients have been redefined in terms of the mixing ratio, which is the fundamentally conserved quantity, rather than the measured water vapor mass concentration. Both the velocity and scalar roughness lengths have been changed. For the velocity roughness, the original fixed value of the Charnock parameter has been replaced by one that increases with wind speeds of between 10 and 18 m s−1. The scalar roughness length parameterization has been simplified to fit both an early set of NOAA/Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL) experiments and the Humidity Exchange Over the Sea (HEXOS) program. These changes slightly increase the fluxes for wind speeds exceeding 10 m s−1. For interested users, two simple parameterizations of the surface gravity wave influence on fluxes have been added (but not evaluated). This new version of the algorithm (COARE 3.0) was based on published results and 2777 1-h covariance flux measurements in the ETL inventory. To test it, 4439 new values from field experiments between 1997 and 1999 were added, which now dominate the database, especially in the wind speed regime beyond 10 m s−1, where the number of observations increased from 67 to about 800. After applying various quality controls, the database was used to evaluate the algorithm in several ways. For an overall mean, the algorithm agrees with the data to within a few percent for stress and latent heat flux. The agreement is also excellent when the bulk and directly measured fluxes are averaged in bins of 10-m neutral wind speed. For a more stringent test, the average 10-m neutral transfer coefficients were computed for stress and moisture in wind speed bins, using different averaging schemes with fairly similar results. The average (mean and median) model results agreed with the measurements to within about 5\% for moisture from 0 to 20 m s−1. For stress, the covariance measurements were about 10\% higher than the model at wind speeds over 15 m s−1, while inertial-dissipation measurements agreed closely at all wind speeds. The values for stress are between 8\% (for inertial dissipation) and 18\% (for covariance) higher at 20 m s−1 than two other classic results. Twenty years ago, bulk flux schemes were considered to be uncertain by about 30\%; the authors find COARE 3.0 to be accurate within 5\% for wind speeds of 0–10 m s−1 and 10\% for wind speeds of between 10 and 20 m s−1.},

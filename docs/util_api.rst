Utility Functions
=================

.. note::

    These are functions that are primarily used internally by the COARE algorithm.
    However, they are exposed to the user as a part of the public API for the sake of transparency and convenience.
    Note that documentation for these functions will not be as complete as the documentation for the COARE algorithm itself.
